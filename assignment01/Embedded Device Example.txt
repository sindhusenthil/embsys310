Example of embedded systems - digital thermometer
Working - Temperature measured from sensor circuit, sent to ADC converter, MCU samples the digital readings with its own timer, processing and sends reading to LCD display
Possible challenges - microcontroller self heating causing an offset in temperature readings, electromagnetic interferences
